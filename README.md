Open Source Home Automation
===

MGMT-CENTER is an open source home automation project to make your home more intelligent. The main features are the management of temperature, humidity, light and alarm. The behaviour of the app is implemented as responsive design to provide the best support for several devices. The software is based on one raspberry pi (master) and any count of arduinos (slaves). Each arnuino acts as satellite station which can measure the environment.
